------------

Write a program that crawls a given website (up to 3 levels deep, maximum 50 pages) and counts all input elements (<inputâ€¦) per page. The counts per page are for the inputs on that page plus all the inputs of the pages it refers to. Performance is a key factor so do a few optimizations 
for performance, like concurrent processing of the web pages.
